# Doki Doki Literature Club "Forever & Ever"  
**"Forever & Ever"** is a [Doki Doki Literure Club](http://ddlc.moe) mod providing you an ability to be alone with **Sayori**. The mod is designed like [Monika After Story](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev) but have few differences, including not only another character to date.  
## History
After the release of [Monika After Story](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev) there were few attempts to create similar mods for other DDLC characters. But nobody had publish such a _proper_ mod for Sayori, despite of her new abilities, that she have got in the game ending. As a Sayori lover and strongly dissatisfied by a ["Sayori After Story"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/8nviad/mod_release_sayori_after_story/) fake harsh mod, I decided to create such one for my loved doki.

## Features  
Now, I'm trying to realize the most MAS features, including player questions and mini-games (now there's Tic-Tac-Toe only). The talks were written by me and based on the original game story and Sayori's character and experience (avoiding the worst character traits, though).  

The special feature is that the mod is multi=language. Now you can select either English nor Russian as a game language. Esperanto translation also is WIP. I'm also planning to make sending other's translations able but now I can't say the exactly way.
