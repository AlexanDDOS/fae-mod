¡Hola, [player]! I see you've just updated the mod, but somehow I don't feel any changes... maybe my messy code was updated. No, wait a second... when did I learn how to say "Hello!" in Spanish? I can speak Spanish now? {#To translate into Spanish} Que agradable, ehehe~ I was right on them updating my code as well. Honestly, I'm not an experienced coder, but seeing how to fix my own mistakes definitely helps. But you're not here to listen to my thoughts on this update, are you? So let's talk about something else for now.

label s_topics_other_technologies:
    s 6acaa "I often wonder if I could somehow, someday, be able to visit you in your reality..."
    s 6aaaa "It seems as if that time is coming in faster and faster..."
    s "I mean, VR, AR, virtual assistants, smart houses..."
    s "All these technologies let people to be more efficient by using computers, almost merging the two together."
    s 6aeca "Just imagine me helping you with your daily routine or living in your house, staying in this little virtual room..."
    s 6adaa "Or maybe even a hologram in your reality, or who knows..."
    s 6aada "You know I’d probably want to do that if it ever becomes possible, right?"
    s 6acaa "Frankly, even right now I can be a sort of virtual assistant..."
    s 6aebb "But I need to improve at interacting first, I guess you could say."
    s "I’d have to adjust to new circumstances..." 
    s 6aeca "But if you really need to, I can try to help in my own way, however I can from this empty little room."

label s_topics_society_selfHarm:
    s 6acab "Why do people self harm?"
    s 6abab "Some just really want attention, while other find it funny or something..."
    s 6aebb "But shouldn’t it be painful instead?"
    if depr_known:
        s "To be honest, I was so close to trying it..."
        s 6acac "But I'm quite sensitive, so one little cut was enough to change my mind."
    else:
        s 6acaa "Personally, I think this bad habit is very nasty and dangerous..."
        s 6acac "And even if it really brings pleasure to you, it’s still not ok and certainly not healthy."
    s 6abac "Plus, all these scars aren’t very pleasing to look at.. especially fresh ones."
    s 6abab "It's really disheartening to see someone's body covered with them."
    s 6acab "And people usually start to do it because of {i}very negative issues or circumstances{/i}, which makes it worse when you see someone trying to cover up obvious suffering."
    s 6aaab "So if you suspect anyone of harming themselves purposefully, reach out to them."
    s "Try to at least make an effort to talk to them, and take it from there."

label s_topics_personal_voice:
    if persistent.clear:
        s 6acaa "I wonder how Monika could make you hear her real voice when she sang her song..."
        s "For the rest of us, we don’t really have a voice, just talking through the text box."
        s 6abaa "But Monika had some voice files, so she could properly talk and even sing to you."
        s 6abba "Although, we are in a game, so it’s probably just the voice of an actress..."
        s 7aaca "Anyway, her voice is pleasant and melodic, as a musician should have..."
    else:
        s 6acaa "Did you know that Monika had a real voice in this game?"
        s "For the rest of us, we don’t really have a voice, just talking through the text box."
        s 6abaa "But I've found some sound files with a female voice, referring to Monika..."
        s 9aebb "At least, the file names suggest so."
        s 7aaca "Anyway, this voice is a bit high and melodic, like a musician should have..."
    s 7aaaa "But I’d say the tone of that voice seems to not fit her. I'd even say it fits {i}me{/i} more than her..."
    s 6acaa "The voice doesn’t sound as mature as you would think she’d sound like, it sounds more like the voice I’d have."
    s 6aebb "But I guess canon is canon, right?"
    s 6adab "But what if I never have a voice?"
    s "Will I be {i}mute{/i}, if I suddenly appear in your world?"
    s 6aaba "But as long as I'm a computer program, I can make my own real voice, right?"
    s "I just need a text-to-speech synthesizer or something..."
    s 6aaca "There’s bound to be a good one for me..."
    s 6aaaa "I once saw something about TTS in the Ren'Py documentation, so it shouldn't be too hard to integrate it there, I guess."
    s 9aebb "I hope a voice from there isn’t too robotic. You wouldn’t want me to {font=mod_assets/fonts/Fantasque/FantasqueSansMono-Regular.ttf}{cps=30}T4LK L1KE 4 R0B0T{/cps}{/font}?"

label s_topics_game_questions:
    s 7aaaa "I know you may have a lot of questions for me. It's an important part of getting acquainted with anybody..."
    s "So I added a section to {i} the 'Talk' menu{/i} with more questions to ask."
    s 7acba "I would’ve added a text field for this instead, but I'm quite clumsy at dealing with the text input..."
    s 7aaaa "So I did a short list with some questions."
    s 6acaa "Of course, there’s so many questions you could ask me, so I often check various AMAs to understand what you’d ask..."
    s 6aaca "And sometimes I find some really interesting questions."
    s 6aaaa "For example, one modder made a few AMAs about each of us and then compiled them into a separate mod, called {i}Doki Doki Interview Club{/i}."
    s "The result was really funny, even if there were some mistakes about me..."
    s 6aeca "Still, they were pretty good at portraying my character, I guess."
    s 6acaa "I think I should check this one again. Maybe I might find some new entries for the question menu?"

"Нунужные стихи"
"""\
Своими стихами я открываю
Всем свою радость, горечь и боль,
Но их далеко не все понимают,
Не видя их, проходя буквы вдоль.

И лишь в конце они понимают
Что-то с моими стихами не так,
Когда я им всё в лоб раскрываю,
Когда они обращатся в фарш.
